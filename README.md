# beginner_rails_site
a simple site for learning rails 

url's: 
loops under:
http://localhost:3000/

a form with Active Record (unfinished) 
http://localhost:3000/posts/new

things I want to get working:
-> using Active Record with a rails formatted form to use a sql model
  -- now using sqlite (default), change to myslq? 
-> working with ruby object / class structure in rails 
  -- looks like rails makes classes for me that interact with views, way to define my own classes?
